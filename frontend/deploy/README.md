# Build and Deployment Guidelines

## Docker

- [TBD] Prepare necessary docker files
  - Image size => should be as much small as possible
    - Build, deploy and container start gets faster
- Services

  - DockerHub
  - Github Container Registry
    - Permissions are easy to manage
    - Is there any other drawback?

## Github Actions

Use for testing and deployment

- [TBD] github test action
- [TBD] github build action
- [TBD] github deploy action
- Will vary on language/ stack
